\section*{Professional Experience}
\textbf{Founder / Principal Engineer} \hfill Feb 2025 -- Present \\
\textit{Mailio} \hfill \href{https://mail.io}{mail.io}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Founded and built \textbf{Mailio}, a privacy-first email platform integrating \textbf{end-to-end encryption} with \textbf{client-side embedding generation with cloud-based semantic search} and \textbf{AI-driven fraud detection}.
    \item Designed and deployed \textbf{Transformer-based models} (E5, MiniLM) for email intent classification, similarity search, and contextual ranking; combined embedding features with tabular metadata in an \textbf{XGBoost ensemble} to detect spam, phishing, impersonation, and spear-phishing attacks.
    \item Implemented \textbf{continuous retraining and drift monitoring} (PSI, ROC-AUC tracking)
    \item Architected a distributed backend in \textbf{Go, Python, and TypeScript} with \textbf{Kubernetes}, \textbf{CouchDB}, and \textbf{Pinecone}, supporting real-time synchronization and per-user encrypted data stores.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Principal Engineer — AI \& Machine Learning Systems} \hfill San Francisco\\
\textit{Azumio, CocoonCam, Chrysalis Cloud, HaloVision} \hfill Jan 2014 -- Jul 2025
\begin{itemize}
 \item Led development of \textbf{HaloVision}, an \textbf{AI-driven confidential conversation analytics platform} designed to surface hidden blockers within organizations. 
Implemented \textbf{LLM-powered call summarization and information-extraction pipelines}, combining prompt-based reasoning with \textbf{traditional ML techniques} (topic modeling, clustering, paraphrase-similarity scoring) to ensure accuracy and enable human-in-the-loop review. 
Delivered the full system—from prototype to onboarding first enterprise clients—in under three months.
 \item Developed \textbf{Chrysalis Cloud}, a distributed \textbf{video-streaming and ML inference framework} derived from CocoonCam’s production infrastructure. 
Enabled developers and enterprises to stream video to the cloud for \textbf{real-time AI analysis} using modular inference pipelines (object detection, motion tracking, pose estimation,...). 
Achieved \textbf{60× cost efficiency} compared to AWS Kinesis. 
\href{https://github.com/igorrendulic/video-edge-ai-proxy}{(GitHub)} \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWCgTW2Ar5s}{(Demo Video)}
 \item Served as lead backend engineer for \textbf{CocoonCam}, an \textbf{AI-powered baby monitor} platform using computer vision for real-time motion and breathing detection. 
Designed and scaled the \textbf{video ingestion and ML inference backend}, processing over \textbf{15 PB of video data monthly} and supporting tens of thousands of live streams. 
The platform’s success led to its \textbf{acquisition by Alarm.com}, generating millions in annual revenue and high user retention. 
\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/cocoon-cam-review-a-smart-baby-monitor-that-detects-breathing.html}{(CNBC Review)}
    \item Built and deployed \textbf{Calorie Mama}, a deep-learning food-image recognition and nutrition-analytics platform with over \textbf{100k+ food/barcode classes} and multi-language support. 
Achieved \textbf{~88\% top-5 accuracy} and integrated the technology into \textbf{Samsung Bixby (Galaxy S9+)}; also licensed the \textbf{Food Recognition AI API} to third-party partners, including \textbf{Helix} for DNA-based meal and workout personalization.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{R\&D Engineer (formerly Junior Software Engineer)} \hfill Ljubljana, Slovenia\\
\textit{SRC Infonet (formerly InfoNET; acquired by SRC)} \hfill 2008 -- 2012
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed and prototyped a \textbf{proxy-based HL7 document exchange platform} (\textit{medGateway}); the solution was productized and deployed within Slovenia’s national e-health ecosystem (integrations with ePrescriptions and CRPP) leading to my transition into a dedicated \textbf{R\&D} role.
\end{itemize}
